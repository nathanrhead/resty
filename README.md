### Setup

#### User Stories

- As a user, I expect an easy-to-read and understandable user interface, so that I can use the application intuitively.
- As a user, I want to enter the URL to a REST API and select the REST method to use to access it.
- As a user, I want visual confirmation that my entries and selections are valid, so that I have confidence the application will be able to fetch the API data that Iâ€™ve requested.

#### Developer Stories

- As a developer, I want to create a visually appealing site with a header, footer, and a large content area.
- As a developer, I want to create a form that asks for a URL.
- As a developer, I want to create buttons that let the user choose from the REST methods of get, post, put, and delete.
- When the form is filled out and the button is clicked, I want to display the URL and the method chosen.
